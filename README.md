# Project Idea ðŸ’¡  

This project focuses on the classification of paper, plastic, and garbage bags using the MobileNet and ResNet50 deep learning models and show the best accuracy from them. The goal is to develop an efficient and accurate model that can distinguish between these three types of bags, which are commonly encountered in waste management and recycling applications.
